 [E] [F#m11/E] [Emaj7] [F#m11/E]

{c:Verse 1}
[E]Crossroads[F#m11/E], seem to come and [Emaj7]go, yea[F#m11/E]h.
[E]The gypsy flies from coast to [F#m11/E]coast
[A]Knowing [Bm(add4)]many, loving n[C#m]one, [D6(9)]
[E]Bearing [F#m11]sorrow havin' fu[G#m11]n, [Aadd9]
[Cmaj7]But back home he'll always r[B]un 
to sweet meliss[E]a.[F#m11/E] m[Emaj7]mm[F#m11/E].

{c:Verse 2}
[E]Freight train,[F#m11/E] each car looks the sa[Emaj7]me, al[F#m11/E]l the same.
[E]And no one knows the gyp[F#m11/E]sy's name
[A]No one h[Bm(add4)]ears his lonely s[C#m]igh, [D6(9)]
[E]There are no bl[F#m11]ankets where he lie[G#m11]s. [Aadd9]
[Cmaj7]In all his deepest dreams the gypsy fl[B]ies 
with sweet mel[E]issa.[F#m11/E] [Emaj7] mm[F#m11/E]m

{c:Bridge}
[E]Again the morning's come,
[D]Again he's on the run,
[A]Sunbeams shining through his hair,
[B]Appearing not to have a care.
[C#m]Well, pick up your gear and gypsy ro[A]ll on, r[B]oll on.

{c:Verse 3}
[E]Crossroads,[F#m11/E] will you ever let him g[Emaj7]o? (lord, l[F#m11/E]ord)
[E]Will you hide the dead ma[F#m11/E]n's ghost,
[A]Or will he [Bm(add4)]lie, beneath the c[C#m]lains, [D6(9)]
[E]Or will his spi[F#m11]rit fall away[G#m11]?  [Aadd9]
[Cmaj7]But I know that he won't st[B]ay 
without melis[E]sa[F#m11/E]. 
[Cmaj7]Yes I know that he won't st[B]ay 
without melis[E]sa[F#m11/E]. [Emaj7] [F#m11/E]
