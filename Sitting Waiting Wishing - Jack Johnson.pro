Intro:
[Am] [Am7] [G] [G7] [F] [F7] [C] [C7]

{c: Verse}
[Am]Well I was sitting, [Am7]waiting, wishing
[G]You believed in [G7]superstitions
[F]Then maybe you'd [F7]see the [C]signs
The [Am]Lord knows that this [Am7]world is cruel
I [G]ain't the Lord, no I'm [G7]just a fool
Learning [F]lovin' somebody [F7]don't make them [C]love you

{c: Chorus}
Must I [E]always be waiting, waiting on [Am]you    [Am7]      [Am]     [Am7]
Must I [E]always be playing, playing your [Am]fool [Am7]      [Am]     [Am7]

{c: Verse}
I [Am]sang your songs, I [Am7]danced your dance
I [G]gave your friends [G7]all a chance
But [F]putting up with them
[F7]Wasn't worth never [C]having you   [C7]
[Am]Maybe you've been through [Am7]this before
But it's [G]my first time so [G7]please ignore
The [F]next few lines cause [F7]they're directed at you

{c: Verse}
Must I [E]always be waiting, waiting on [Am*]you    [Am7]      [Am]     [Am7]
Must I [E]always be playing, playing your [Am*]fool [Am7]      [Am]     [Am7]

{c: Verse}
[C]I keep playing your [E]part but it's not my [F]scene
Want [F]this plot to [G]twist I've had e[F]nough mystery
[C]You keep building it [E]up then shooting me [F]down
But I'm [F]already [G]down just [G]wait a minute
[Am]   [Am7]    [G] Just [G7]sitting, wai[F]ting [F7]
[C]Just [C7]wait a min[Am]ute [Am7]     [G]Just [G7]sitting, [F]waiting  [F7]    [C]   [C7]
Well, [Am]if I was in [Am7]your position
I'd [G]put down all my [G7]ammunition
I'd [F]wonder why'd it [F7]taken me so [C]long  [C7]
But [Am]Lord knows that I'm [Am7]not you
And [G]if I was, I wouldn't [G7]be so cruel
Cause [F]waitin' on love aint [F7]so easy to [C]do   [C7]

{c: Chorus}
Must I [E]always be waiting, waiting on [Am]you    [Am7]      [Am]     [Am7]
Must I [E]always be playing, playing your [Am]fool [Am7]      [Am]     [Am7]
No, I can't I [E]always be waiting, waiting on [Am]you  [Am7]      [Am]     [Am]
I can't [E]always be playing, playing your f[Am]ool  [Am7]      [Am]     [Am]
